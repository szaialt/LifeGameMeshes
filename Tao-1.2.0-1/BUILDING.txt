There are two ways of building Tao; one requiring GNU make, and a win32-only
batch file build.  Please contact the tao mailing list with any problems;
see http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/tao-list .

1. Using GNU make
=================

This is the preferred way to build Tao; however, it does require that GNU make
and a minimal toolset (cp, mkdir) be installed.  A minimal cygwin install
should be sufficient.

The build has two steps:

* Config file selection.  Type "make help" to see the options:

% make help
Use "make [targetname]" to configure the build
valid targets:
  net-1.1        .NET 1.1
  mono-1.1       Mono 1.1

other variables:
  MONODIR        Location to find mono install, mcs will be used from $MONODIR/bin

Selecting one build involves typing "make net-1.1", e.g.:

% make net-1.1
rm -f config.mk; cp config/net-1-1.mk config.mk
config.mk installed; re-run make.

* Building.  Simply type "make".  The resulting DLLs will be placed in dist/bin,
and examples will be in dist/clean. If you wish to strongname the assemblies (as is
recommended), build with "make STRONG=1".

2. Using batch files
====================

Two batch files are provided, "build.bat" and "buildstrong.bat".  The second
is equivalent to the first, except that it builds strong named assemblies.
